21 Day Form
=======

This meteor app allows for a single user to enter info on the 21 day fix and create images from it. That last image thing required phantom js, which is seperate from meteor. There is no actual hosted site anywhere. This is intentional, as I'd be really surprised if that didn't violate terms or something with BeachBody.
